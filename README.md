## Tank game
Our game idea is to make 2d tanks game. You see the gameboard from an areal view. The
game is made for either 1 or 2 players. The players have the option to compete against each
other or against the computer. The objective is to blow the opponent up. On the grid are a
set of obstacles and powerups. There are some different types of level designs as well,
disguised as “levels”.

## Week 1:
Have a functioning tanks with health that can move around and shoot each other. Have a
grid of either destroyable and non destroyable bocks.

## Week 2:
Powerups, menu screen, game over screen. Game logic, instruction and practical game
design impementations.

## Week 3:
Make the AI for playing agains the computer. Make different types of levels. Finalize the
product.

### Powerups
* Speed
* Bomb
* Shield
